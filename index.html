              <li> Two Nigerian universities have launched startup hubs. The one in the University of Nsukka has a funny name, but we'll allow it. The other one is in Covenant University, which is intriguing, because as far as I know, that school has an interesting list of banned items, and it includes mobile phones. And no, I have no idea why grown college students aren't allowed to use mobile phones. Nigerians like to do the most.</li>
              <li>While their Nigerian counterparts are launching weirdly named startup hubs, the University of Stellenbosch is launching a satellite. A nano-satellite, but a satellite nonetheless. Do they have two heads? Link

                  <li> This thread about a Nigerian online merchant's experience with Pay on Delivery is wild. The numbers this dude is doing are off the charts, what the hell is he selling? He says "slim tea" I'm literally not buying it.</li>
                  <li>Of course it gets better. I have good reason to believe that the thread originator is none other than the infamous Dr. Azolibe. But Radar people don't seem to have wised up to this yet. This is how I'll find out if Radar users are subscribed to the digest, lol.</li>
                  <li>If you are Nigerian and don't know who Dr. Azolibe is, you are quite lucky. He is only the biggest email spammer this side of the Atlantic. Don't even ask what his emails and products are about.</li>
                  <li>Curiosity killed the cat of course, here you go, don't regret it.</li>
                  <li>But seriously, is it time to kill Pay on delivery? Life seems to be Eazi-er without it.</li>
                  <li> Like the horror stories of PoD should discourage any sane online vendor. What do you think?</li>
